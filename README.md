# Gmail MCP

[![CI](https://github.com/george43g/gmail-mcp/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/george43g/gmail-mcp/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

A Gmail integration with 33 MCP tools, a scriptable `gmail` CLI, an interactive console, and a keyboard-driven terminal UI.

This project is a history-preserving fork of [GongRzhe/Gmail-MCP-Server](https://github.com/GongRzhe/Gmail-MCP-Server). It also ports useful behavior contributed through [ArtyMcLabin/Gmail-MCP-Server](https://github.com/ArtyMcLabin/Gmail-MCP-Server). Original authors and contributors remain credited in the Git history and MIT license.

## Install

Node.js 20.6 or newer is required. The package exposes one binary, `gmail`.

```bash
npm install --global @george43g/gmail-mcp
gmail --version
```

You can also run it without a global install:

```bash
npx @george43g/gmail-mcp --help
```

## Authenticate

1. Create a Google Cloud project and enable the Gmail API.
2. Create an OAuth client. A Desktop client is simplest; a Web client must allow `http://localhost:3000/oauth2callback`.
3. Save the downloaded client JSON as `~/.gmail-mcp/gcp-oauth.keys.json`.
4. Authenticate a named account:

```bash
gmail account auth personal
```

The command opens a browser, asks which scopes to grant, and writes tokens to `~/.gmail-mcp/accounts/personal/credentials.json`. Explicit authentication uses Google's consent prompt so a refresh token is returned. Rotated access tokens are written back only when credentials were loaded from a file; env and 1Password sources remain read-only.

For a remote machine, use the headless display plus an SSH port forward:

```bash
ssh -L 3000:localhost:3000 user@server
gmail account auth personal --headless
```

The built-in callback listener is plain HTTP and accepts only `http://` callback URLs. Put TLS on the MCP HTTP transport, not on this local OAuth callback.

## MCP Hosts

Example stdio configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gmail": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@george43g/gmail-mcp", "mcp"],
      "env": { "GMAIL_ACCOUNT": "personal" }
    }
  }
}
```

Run two account-specific processes with distinct MCP tool names:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gmail-work": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@george43g/gmail-mcp", "mcp", "--tool-prefix", "work_"],
      "env": { "GMAIL_ACCOUNT": "work" }
    },
    "gmail-personal": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@george43g/gmail-mcp", "mcp", "--tool-prefix", "personal_"],
      "env": { "GMAIL_ACCOUNT": "personal" }
    }
  }
}
```

`--tool-prefix` and `GMAIL_MCP_TOOL_PREFIX` affect only names advertised over MCP. CLI, console, and TUI dispatch continue to use canonical names.

## CLI and TUI

```bash
gmail account                 # interactive account manager
gmail account list
gmail search "from:alerts@example.com" --json
gmail inbox --max 25
gmail read <messageId>
gmail threads get <threadId>
gmail send -t person@example.com -s "Status" -b @message.txt
gmail draft -t person@example.com -s "Status" -b @message.txt --json
gmail update-draft <draftId> -t person@example.com -s "Revised" -b @message.txt
gmail send-draft <draftId>
gmail report-phishing <messageId>
gmail tui
gmail console
```

`--json` emits typed structured output for scripts. Human output remains readable text.

The TUI supports inbox/search browsing, account switching, thread and attachment views, label operations, compose/reply/reply-all through `$EDITOR`, themes, and responsive panes. Editor content autosaves under `~/.gmail-mcp/drafts/`; the local file is removed only after Gmail confirms a successful send or draft creation. First-class editing of existing Gmail Drafts remains a later enhancement.

See [the screenshot gallery](docs/SCREENSHOTS.md) for the current layouts and key flows.

## Draft Lifecycle

`draft_email` returns both `draftId` and the backward-compatible `messageId` alias. Continue editing and send the same Gmail draft without creating orphan copies:

```text
draft_email -> update_draft (zero or more times) -> send_draft
```

`send_draft` maps to `users.drafts.send`, `update_draft` to `users.drafts.update`, and `delete_draft` to `users.drafts.delete`.

## Inline Images

`send_email`, `draft_email`, `update_draft`, and `reply_all` accept `inlineImages`. Reference each CID from `htmlBody`:

```json
{
  "to": ["person@example.com"],
  "subject": "Report",
  "body": "The HTML version includes the chart.",
  "htmlBody": "<p>Results</p><img src=\"cid:chart\">",
  "inlineImages": [
    { "cid": "chart", "path": "/absolute/path/chart.png" }
  ]
}
```

Base64 input uses `content` plus `contentType`. Each image must use exactly one source, a safe raster MIME type, a valid CID, and no more than 10 MB decoded content. SVG is intentionally unsupported. The CLI accepts repeatable `--inline-image cid=/path/image.png`; pass a JSON object to the same option for base64 content.

## Accounts

```bash
gmail account auth work
gmail account auth personal
gmail account list
gmail account use work
gmail account check --all
gmail account rename work company
gmail account rm company
```

A process has one active account at a time. `list_accounts` and `switch_account` let an MCP session switch that active account; they do not merge mailboxes. The console and TUI provide explicit single-account and combined browse scopes with account provenance on combined rows.

Environment-driven credentials (`GMAIL_CREDENTIALS_JSON` or `GMAIL_CREDENTIALS_OP`) are single-account by design. To expose two env-backed accounts, run two processes with different environment blocks and tool prefixes.

## OAuth Scopes

| Scope | Capability |
|---|---|
| `gmail.readonly` | Read/search/download mail |
| `gmail.modify` | Read and modify labels; does not permanently delete |
| `gmail.compose` | Create drafts and send |
| `gmail.send` | Send only |
| `gmail.labels` | Manage labels |
| `gmail.full` | Full mailbox access, including permanent deletion |
| `gmail.settings.basic` | Manage filters/basic settings |
| `gmail.settings.sharing` | Manage delegation/sharing settings |

`gmail.full` satisfies all mail scopes, but not either settings scope. Permanent `delete_email` and `batch_delete_emails` require `gmail.full`. The default remains `gmail.modify,gmail.settings.basic`, which deliberately excludes permanent deletion.

```bash
gmail account auth reader --scopes=gmail.readonly
gmail account auth full --scopes=gmail.full,gmail.settings.basic
```

Tools outside the active account's granted scopes are hidden from `tools/list` and rejected at call time.

## Tool Catalog

### Read and Threads

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `read_email` | Read a message, including To/CC/BCC, readable body, and attachments |
| `search_emails` | Search with Gmail query syntax |
| `download_attachment` | Save an attachment safely |
| `get_thread` | Read a compact chronological thread transcript |
| `list_inbox_threads` | List query-matching threads with pagination |
| `get_inbox_with_threads` | List and optionally expand threads |
| `modify_thread` | Add/remove labels on a whole thread |
| `download_email` | Export JSON, EML, TXT, or HTML |

### Send, Drafts, and Message Actions

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `send_email` | Send text/HTML mail, attachments, and inline images |
| `draft_email` | Create a Gmail draft |
| `send_draft` | Send an existing draft atomically |
| `update_draft` | Replace an existing draft's content |
| `delete_draft` | Delete a draft |
| `reply_all` | Build recipients and threading headers automatically |
| `modify_email` | Add/remove message labels |
| `delete_email` | Permanently delete one message (`gmail.full`) |
| `batch_modify_emails` | Modify labels for up to 500 messages |
| `batch_delete_emails` | Permanently delete up to 500 messages (`gmail.full`) |
| `report_phishing` | Apply `SPAM` to one message |
| `batch_report_phishing` | Apply `SPAM` to multiple messages |

The Gmail API has no public endpoint for Gmail's native Report phishing workflow. The two phishing-named tools clearly report that they apply the `SPAM` label as the closest public API behavior.

### Labels, Filters, and Meta

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `list_email_labels` | List system and user labels |
| `create_label` | Create a label |
| `update_label` | Rename/change label visibility |
| `delete_label` | Delete a label |
| `get_or_create_label` | Idempotently resolve a label |
| `list_filters` | List filters |
| `get_filter` | Get one filter |
| `create_filter` | Create a filter |
| `delete_filter` | Delete a filter |
| `create_filter_from_template` | Create a common filter pattern |
| `health_check` | Local process health without a Gmail call |
| `list_accounts` | List configured accounts |
| `switch_account` | Swap the active account for subsequent calls |

## HTTP Transport

```bash
export GMAIL_HTTP_TOKEN="$(openssl rand -hex 32)"
gmail mcp --http --bind 127.0.0.1 --port 8080
```

Endpoints:

- `POST /mcp`: Streamable HTTP MCP, requires `Authorization: Bearer ...`
- `GET /health`: open process-health probe

The server is single-tenant: one process, one active Gmail account. Keep the default loopback bind and terminate TLS at a trusted reverse proxy.

## Docker

Build the local image and mount the config directory:

```bash
docker build -t gmail-mcp:2.0.0 .
docker run --rm -it \
  -v "$HOME/.gmail-mcp:/gmail-server" \
  gmail-mcp:2.0.0 account list

docker run --rm -i \
  -v "$HOME/.gmail-mcp:/gmail-server:ro" \
  -e GMAIL_ACCOUNT=personal \
  gmail-mcp:2.0.0 mcp
```

Use env-inline OAuth keys and credentials instead of a volume for CI or container platforms that provide secret injection.

## Environment

The main settings are:

- `GMAIL_CONFIG_DIR`, `GMAIL_ACCOUNT`
- `GMAIL_OAUTH_KEYS_JSON`, `GMAIL_OAUTH_PATH`
- `GMAIL_CREDENTIALS_JSON`, `GMAIL_CREDENTIALS_OP`, `GMAIL_CREDENTIALS_PATH`
- `GMAIL_SCOPES`, `GMAIL_AUTH_NON_INTERACTIVE`
- `GMAIL_MCP_TOOL_PREFIX`, `GMAIL_HTTP_TOKEN`
- `MCP_*` timeout, retry, rate-limit, logging, and watchdog controls

See [.env.example](.env.example) for the complete reference. `.env` and `.env.local` are gitignored; `.env.local` wins.

## Development

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm verify
pnpm run stress
pnpm run screenshots:check
npm run package:check
```

`pnpm verify` runs lint, type checking, unit tests, clean build, fixture e2e, usage drift, tarball inspection, and a production dependency audit. Both `pnpm-lock.yaml` and `package-lock.json` are maintained. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) and [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
