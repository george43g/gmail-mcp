// Three-tier responsive width allocation for the TUI's main panes.
//
// The detail pane is capped at 100 columns regardless of terminal width —
// long prose lines past ~80-100 chars hurt readability (the eye loses its
// place during the saccade back to the next line start). At terminal widths
// above the cap the surplus flows back into the thread list, which CAN
// usefully absorb more horizontal space (sender, date, subject all benefit).
//
// Tiers (chosen by total terminal columns):
//
//   Compact      ≤ 120 cols:  sidebar=22, threadList min, detail = rest
//   Comfortable  121-180:     sidebar=24, threadList=44, detail capped 100
//   Wide         ≥ 181:       sidebar=28, detail=100, surplus → threadList (cap 80)
//
// Border + padding overhead per pane is ~4 cols (border + paddingX=1 either
// side). The widths returned here are the OUTER pane widths (the value you
// pass to <Box width={...}>); inner content has 4 fewer cols.
